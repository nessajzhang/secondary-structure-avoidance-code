# secondary-structure-avoidance-code
codes for secondary structure avoidance for DNA storage

# Requirements: 
random

# main:
count m-long reverse-complement in your designed DNA sequence

# example-gcha:
example of gc-balance and homopolymers avoiding sequences

# example n=256, m=18:
when n=256, m=18, count how many reverse-complement in the sequence

# generate:
how to generate random DNA sequence
